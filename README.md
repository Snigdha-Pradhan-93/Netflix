Netflix Movies and TV Shows
🎉 I've just completed building a Netflix Dashboard using Power BI 🚀
📊 My dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset, which I collected from Kaggle. Here are some of the key insights I've visualized:
1.Genres at a Glance: Visualized the distribution of titles across different genres using a clustered bar chart. 📊🎥
2.TV Shows vs. Movies: Explored the content mix on Netflix by creating an engaging donut chart. Now we can easily see the ratio of TV shows to movies. 🍩📺🎬
3.Ratings Breakdown: Used a clustered bar chart to showcase how titles are rated on Netflix. It's fascinating to see how different ratings stack up! 📊⭐️👍
4.Global Content: Unveiled the top 5 countries producing movies and TV shows through an interactive tree map. It's amazing to witness the international diversity of content. 🗺️🌍📽️
5.Decades of Entertainment: Mapped the journey of Netflix content over the years using an area chart, providing insights into the growth of their library. 📈📅🎉
